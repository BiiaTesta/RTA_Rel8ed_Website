            <h2>What is the Robot Training Academy?</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>A training program in Data Processing and Data Understanding.</p>
            <p>Under the guidance of rel8ed.to staff, students gain first-hand experience in the world of data science. Learn the basics of data research, cleaning, and modelling (with some more advanced work for those who want to learn, too!). </p>
            <p>You'll leave with the experience to launch your own data science career -- whether that's with our team or with other organizations. (Fun fact, 90% of the rel8ed.to team started in the Robot Training Academy!)</p>
            <p>The Academy is for any high school, undergraduate, or graduate student with an interest in data analytics and AI.</p>
            <p>No data experience is required - we'll help you with all that!</p>

            <h2>How does the Academy work?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Students enroll and choose from 2 programs of study: Data Understanding or Data Process (or enroll in both!)</li>
                <li>Attend weekly LIVE workshops and participate in group projects. </li>
                <li>Earn a micro-credential when you complete a course and project. </li>
                <li>Network with peers, your instructors, and experts in the field.</li>
                <li>Get hands-on experience and list your projects on your resume.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>What's required to participate?</h2>
            <p>A computer, access to internet, a few hours a week, and your curiosity in how the world of data works.</p>
            <p>Why? Because here at rel8ed.to we believe the future of AI and Analytics-driven innovations will be defined by the curious thinkers as much as the coders. And we’ve been ignoring the role in finding smart thinkers to help our artificially intelligent systems deliver value.</p>    
            <p>That's why the Robot Training Academy will help you learn both the technical skills in data science AND the analytical skills required to interpret data and fine-tune (or "train") our AI systems.</p>
